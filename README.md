I use this repo to set up my console. In the future I may use it to set up build environments for live image creation as well, so I can bootstrap an OS from this repo. It's currently just tested on Chimera linux. 

Dependencies: `git`, `apk`. 

To install programs:
```
# sh install.sh
```

To put the config files where each program expects them to be:
```
$ fish init.fish
```
