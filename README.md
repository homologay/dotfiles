Coming Soon....

I don't know how Nix works, so this is my way to set up a development environment on void linux (x86, glibc)
in a sorta-ish-not-really reproducible way.  

This repo contains:
  - configuration for alacritty, helix, fish
  - a shell script to install rustc, cargo, and some cargo commands, then run...
  - the installer, which installs some programs and configures some stuff.
