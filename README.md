I'm not sure why anyone would want to replicate my sketchy, hacked-together toolchain, but if you do, here's how:

1. Have void linux installed. I've only tested this on the base, glibc version. 
2. Install git, then clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/maxinebeckie/workflow
```
3. Run the script and pray it works
```
cd workflow
sh init.sh
```
