Note: this is in progress and not working yet.

This is how I set up my development environment on a new machine:

1. Install void linux. I'm only testing this on the base, glibc,
x86_64 version. It might work on different architectures, or with the
xfce version. It almost certainly won't work with musl. 

2. Clone the repo to your `$HOME` directory:
```
cd 
git clone https://github.com/maxinebeckie/workflow
```

3. Run `init.sh`. It will need sudo permissions. 
```
sh init.sh
```

4. Pray

You could also just copy my `.config` files, if you want to see my cute terminal setup.
